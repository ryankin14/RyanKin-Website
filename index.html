        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a full time student at the University of California Riverside. I am a second year student and I currently live on campus. I am a pre-business major with a full course load. I do not have too much work experience because I have been a full time student since the time I started school. I have, however, worked for Postmates. I am looking to gain more experience from jobs now that I am a second year with a little more college experience. I would like to start doing internships in order to further expand my resume and be prepared for work when I graduate from college. Along with the small amount of job experience that I do have, I also have some experience doing community service for an organization I was in. I worked in the organization with different projects such as cleaning up the nature center to packaging and distributing food to the homeless. I want to continue to build a resume that will allow me to flourish in the future.<br><br>
        While I am a pre-business student at the University of California Riverside and I still have time to think about it, I must also plan for my future. When I hopefully get into the school of business, my goal is to focus on accounting and auditing as that is the main major that I wish to pursue. I would like to follow in my aunt's footsteps who currently has an important job in a good company. It is my main goal to eventually become the CFO of a company and make a comfortable living that could sustain me and my family. I think once I graduate, my goal is to work for a company that deals with esports, or real sports. Both video games and sports have been a passion of mine since I was little and I would like to put my interest in them to good use.<br><br>
        I would also like a job opportunity that allows me to grow as a person. I want to have a job that I would like to go to each and every day. One that allows me to flourish and show my talent for not only accounting and auditing, but also my interest in another subject. With sports, I feel like I could add a fantastic perspective as I once played sports in high school. I also continuously watch sports whether it be football, basketball, or baseball. On the other hand, with esports, I feel as though I have a very good understanding and awareness of all the current and future games coming out which would help give my company insight. I have played many games over the course of my life and feel that I could be a big help in seeing what an audience may want.
